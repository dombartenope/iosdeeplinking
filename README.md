# Deep Linking
## Universal Links
The Deeplink must be hosted on web server and follow the guidance in the [documentation here]("https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/deep-linking") if you want to change this to match your own.
- This is [the deeplink]("https://slash-magic-cloak.glitch.me") that is currently set up to be used in this project


# Push To Start Live Activities
## Struct
This uses the default struct provided by the widget when you add that target on XCode. The changes made to the default layout are as follows:
1. [Struct]("https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/push-to-start-live-activities#3-define-the-static-and-dynamic-data-of-your-live-activity") found in [ptsLiveActivity.swift]("https://github.com/dombartenope/iosdeeplinking/blob/main/pts/ptsLiveActivity.swift")
2. [Push To Start method]("https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/push-to-start-live-activities#5-invoke-the-setup-in-the-appdelegate") found in [pushtostartApp.swift]("https://github.com/dombartenope/iosdeeplinking/blob/main/pushtostart/pushtostartApp.swift")
